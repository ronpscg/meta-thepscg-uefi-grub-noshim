I. Adding the meta-thepscg-uefi-grub-noshim layer to your build
=================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer meta-thepscg-uefi-grub-noshim'

II. Misc
========
The layer separates creation and repackaging of LUKS+DM-VERITY images created from the Yocto build, as well as allows to auto-enroll them during run time.
It builds a dracut based initramfs, that uses systemd-cryptsetup and systemd-veritysetup.

To avoid brutal sudo violations during the creation of the images, the final disk image is created outside of this repository.
Additional steps to built from within this layer can be done.

To build the required image, after adding what you need in local.conf, run
```
bitbake signing-wip
```

You could run the alternative `kas` command, but a *kas* yaml file is included in another project that uses this layer.
